# tensorflow_clothing

Here's my first project using TensorFlow! Classifying clothing with images and labels using the tf.keras API!

Since this is my first project using TensorFlow and Neural Net processing, I've included lots of comments in the code so that when I look at this in 1.5 years I may still be able to follow it. :D

Verifying the first 25 image results and their classes match as expected

Results of the model training ~91% accuracy!
